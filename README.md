- 	B9PartSwitch to have option to switch from fuel types in parts that have fuel option (download from original forum thread), big thank you to Blowfish;
	http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/140541-122-b9partswitch-v153-dec-8-switch-fuels-models-nodes-and-more/

-	TAC Life Support. Besides it it's not a hard dependency, i large recomment it, so some parts have volume just to accomodate Life Support Resources;

-	KAS and KIS. This one too, is not a hard dependency, but will evolve the use of parts, for example, Omicron have Fuel hatches just to use with KAS connectors.

-	Universal Storage 2. This is not a hard dependency too, but like KAS and KIS, have parts that can be better used, like connector just for US2 Life Support containers (US2 for TAC Life Support).

-	Remote Tech. Will work with remote tech too.




*Some of the example craft files need Universal Storage (US) to open;

*Some particles for the vtol engine are from HotRockets, Nazari1382, So many thanks from that
